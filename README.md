# Odin-Recipes
This is the first project of The Odin Project (TOP) and is designed to use everything that was learned from the first few lessons.

# Overview
This is a basic website only using HTML. The project was to put together some recipes and designate them to their own pages using what we learned from previous mini assignments. I attempted to do everything from memory and made a few minor mistakes which were easy to fix. 

The one mistake I learned the most from was when I was creating a list and instead of using "li" I created multiple lists with "ls" which did not work as intended. I was changing them 1 by 1 when I noticed it would all highlight as I would double click to edit them. I learned I can use Ctrl + Shift + L and I was able to edit them all at once! Huge time saver.

Another thing that I learned how to do was git add and git commit. These are things that were very briefly introduced but wasn't actually used for anything until this first project. I attempted to git commit after any long changes were done such as finishing my ingredients list etc. Of course I checked to make sure the code worked before commiting so I wasn't commiting any codes that weren't functioning!

Overall this project allowed me the creative freedom to make mistakes and use google to try and solve them as well as reviewing previous TOP pages such as Git Basics to create a simple website with as much memory as possible and re-enforcing the basics of HTML. This project has given me the confidence to easily follow basic HTML rules without any references. I can create the HTML Boiler Plate from memory and implement headings, images, links to new pages, etc. I can also create and modify directories and files through the terminal and now use basic git commands with confidence.
