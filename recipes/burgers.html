    <p> <h1>Description</h1></p>

    <p>This is Dan's Famous Burger! Below you will find the ingredients needed. I prefer to make it a double because I am a huge fan of beef but this can easily be made a single as well. I hope you enjoy your finished product, you can't really go wrong with a burger, just make sure you don't burn it!</p>
